# ReduxSimpleStarter_WeatherApp

This is a repo that is built by coding along with Stephen Grider in his popular Modern React with Redux Udemy course.

This repo uses React, Redux, Redux Promise, OpenWeatherMap, and GoogleMaps api. The app allows a user to search for cities and display their weather data for the next five days in graph form using the react-sparklines library. Multiple cites can be displayed at once. Only US cities work for right now!

I think he does an excellent job with the course and highly recommend it! See link below to access it.
